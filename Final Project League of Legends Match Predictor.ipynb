    "### Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Perform the following steps to build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [league_of_legends_data_large.csv](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/rk7VDaPjMp1h5VXS-cUyMg/league-of-legends-data-large.csv) file to perform the tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: Load the League of Legends dataset and preprocess it for training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading and preprocessing the dataset involves reading the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features. You will utilize `pandas` for data manipulation, `train_test_split` from `sklearn` for data splitting, and `StandardScaler` for feature scaling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please ensure all the required libraries are installed and imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 .Load the dataset:\n",
    "Use `pd.read_csv()` to load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.</br>\n",
    "2. Split data into features and target: Separate win (target) and the remaining columns (features).</br>\n",
    "   X = data.drop('win', axis=1)</br>\n",
    "   y = data['win'] </br>\n",
    "3 .Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:\n",
    "Use `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide the data. Set `test_size`=0.2 to allocate 20% for testing and 80% for training, and use `random_state`=42 to ensure reproducibility of the split.</br>\n",
    "4. Standardize the features:\n",
    "Use `StandardScaler()` from sklearn.preprocessing to scale the features.</br>\n",
    "5. Convert to PyTorch tensors:\n",
    "Use `torch.tensor()` to convert the data to PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a code to load the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, standardize the features, and convert the data into PyTorch tensors for use in training a PyTorch model.  \n"

    "Optimization techniques such as L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) help in preventing overfitting. The model is retrained with these optimizations, and its performance is evaluated on both training and testing sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight Decay** :In the context of machine learning and specifically in optimization algorithms, weight_decay is a parameter used to apply L2 regularization to the model's parameters (weights). It helps prevent the model from overfitting by penalizing large weight values, thereby encouraging the model to find simpler solutions.To use L2 regularization, you need to modify the optimizer by setting the weight_decay parameter. The weight_decay parameter in the optimizer adds the L2 regularization term during training.\n",

This comprehensive project involved several key steps, including data loading and preprocessing, model implementation, training, optimization, evaluation, visualization, model saving and loading, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis. This project provided hands-on experience with the complete workflow of developing a machine learning model for binary classification tasks using PyTorch.\n",
