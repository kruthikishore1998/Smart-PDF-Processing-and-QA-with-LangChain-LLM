### AI-Powered PDF Question-Answering System  
This project focuses on developing a question-answering (QA) system that utilizes **LangChain** and a **large language model (LLM)** to extract insights from PDF documents. 
The system incorporates key components such as **document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, vector databases, and retrievers** to efficiently process, store, and retrieve relevant information.
By leveraging these technologies, the application enables fast and accurate responses to queries, making it easier to extract knowledge from a companyâ€™s extensive collection of PDF documents.
